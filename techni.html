          <h1>TECHNICAL SKILL</h1>
          <img src="39.jpg" alt="softskill">
          <p>Technical skills are qualities acquired by using and gaining expertise in performing physical or digital tasks. There are many different kinds of technical skills. Traditionally, people working in mathematics, computer science, mechanics and information technology have used many technical skills. Today, however, many more industries rely on employees with technical knowledge. For example, retail and foodservice workers often need to know how to use point-of-sale (POS) software.</p>
          <p>Some specific examples of technical skills might include:</p>
          <p>>>Programming languages<br>
            >>Common operating systems<br>
            >>Software proficiency<br>
            >>Technical writing<br>
            >>Project management<br>
            >>Data analysis</p>

                <h1 id="tooti">Why Are Technical Skill Important?</h1>
                <p id="ocp">Technical skills are important because nearly every job relies on different tools, programs and processes. If you have sought-after technical knowledge and skills common in your industry, you’ll be a more competitive candidate. For example, while a welder may have a positive demeanor and excellent customer service skills (these are good examples of “soft skills”), her skillful handling of a torch will be crucial to her technical and practical success.</p>

                <div>
                    <h1 id="tooti">What Technical Skill you have?</h1>
                    <h3 id="tcp">1.Programming</h3>
                    <P id="ocp">In addition to software engineers, there are many jobs today that require programming knowledge. If you’re looking for a job as a writer, for example, you may be required to have some basic knowledge of HTML.

                        Other highly sought-after programming languages may include:
                        
                    <br> 1. C++<br>
                        2.C#<br>
                        3.Java<br>
                        4.JavaScript<br>
                        5.Perl<br>
                        .PHP<br>
                        7.Python<br></P>
                        <h3 id="tcp">2.Productivity software applications</h3>
                        <P id="ocp">Most industries use both common and specialized software. This often includes what’s known as “productivity software,” or software designed to help get work done faster and more efficiently. Most commonly, this includes word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software.

                            If any of these programs are listed as a requirement in a job description that interests you, you should include them on your resume. However, because this software is so prevalent and often a basic requirement of many jobs, you may not need to list it on your resume unless you know specialized aspects of these programs. </P>
                          
                            <h3 id="tcp">3.Industry Specific Skill</h3>  
                            <P id="ocp">
                                Technical skills vary by industry, so it’s important to do some research on the industry you’re looking to work in. You can do this by looking at job posts from employers in that industry and creating a list of the common technical skills employers list. Highlight those you already possess or can easily learn and consider prioritizing them on your resume.</P>
