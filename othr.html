          <h1>OTHER SKILLS</h1>
          <img src="50.jpg" alt="softskill">
          <p>Soft skills stand out a lot more than you might think in technical interviews. These skills can be a mixture of natural personality traits as well as aptitudes developed from experience and practice.</p>

            <h3 id="tcp">1.Communication And Collaboration</h3>
            <P id="ocp">Working well in a team is essential for almost any job, and many employers in technology are interested in seeing a true spirit of collaboration. “How many times does the person use the word ‘I’ when talking about a group project?” Vancil asks. “Giving credit to others for their contributions is a huge plus.”

                Most people feel nervous in interviews and may not believe they put their best foot forward. But after the interview, you have the chance to score lots of communication points by following up with a phone call. “You will likely only get to leave a message, but it lets us get a feel for how you communicate,” Vancil says. “It’s amazing how many people will simply not talk on the phone.”</P>
        <h3 id="tcp">2.Writing and presenting</h3>
                <P id="ocp">If you are an excellent conversationalist, you might still want to brush up on some of the more formal modes of communication. “I’d advise Computer Science students to also work on soft skills like writing and speaking,” says Mike Soylu, co-founder of Pisano. Many positions involve a responsibility to explain your work to people who don’t understand the technical side of it.

                    Maybe you will give a presentation to board members or stakeholders who are funding your project. Maybe you will work with marketers or project managers who need to understand what your process will be. Whatever the specifics look like, being able to effectively communicate and explain your work is a huge plus. Try challenging yourself by taking a step back from your work and describing what you’re working on to audiences of different technical abilities—if you can explain it simply, it’s a sign of mastery.</P>
                    <h3 id="tcp">3.Self-awareness</h3>
                    <P id="ocp">“I really appreciate a candidate when they have a good sense of self-awareness,” Carlson says. “They know what they're good at and where they need improvement.” Pairing that with a desire to learn is perfect for anyone in technology. If you don’t know where you are lacking, how can you grow? “The most interesting resumes, to me, are those that are asking for opportunities to learn,” Vancil says.

                        You don’t have to pretend to be the absolutely perfect, all-knowing candidate—and attempting to do so may be worse than giving an honest assessment. If you’re interviewing and not sure how to answer a hypothetical problem, acknowledge it and explain the steps you’d take to figure it out.</P>
                        <h3 id="tcp">4. Professionalism</h3>
                        <P id="ocp">Some tech companies are famous for their informal vibes, but no matter what you know about the place you are applying for—show the utmost professionalism. This can apply to how you dress, how you carry yourself and how you talk about your experiences.

                            “Refrain from using words like ‘exceptional’ about yourself unless you can prove that you are far above the curve,” Vancil advises, urging job hunters in technology to also clean up their social media. Consider how you want to be seen by employers and make sure your presence—in person and online—is professional. As appealing as it might be to thumb your nose at convention, take the time to self-evaluate your demeanor and online presence through the eyes of a stranger and ask yourself, “Would I trust this person with important work?”</P>
