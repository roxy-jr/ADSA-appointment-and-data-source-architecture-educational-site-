          <h1>SOFT SKILL</h1>
          <img src="52.jpg" alt="softskill">
          <p>
            Soft skills are a combination of people skills, social skills, communication skills, character or personality traits, attitudes, career attributes, social intelligence and emotional intelligence quotients, among others, that enable people to navigate their environment, work well with others, perform well, and achieve their goals with complementing hard skills. The Collins English Dictionary defines the term "soft skills" as "desirable qualities for certain forms of employment that do not depend on acquired knowledge: they include common sense, the ability to deal with people, and a positive flexible attitude.

            Soft skills is a composite expression, and each of the two words explains a defining aspect of the concept.
            
            The word “skill” highlights the practical function. The term alone has a broad meaning, and describes a particular ability to complete tasks ranging from easier ones like “learning how to kick a ball to harder ones like “learning how to be creative. In this specific instance, the word “skill” has to be interpreted as the ability to master hardly controlled actions.
            
            The word “soft” is the opposite of “hard”, and implies “subjective, fuzzy, and unreliable”, Because of their subjectivity, soft skills are hardly assessed, and never fully mastered. In addition, the vagueness explains why soft skills are not always clearly understood by employers and employees.

          <h1 id="tooti">What Soft Skill You Have?</h1>
          
              <h3 id="tcp">1.COMMUNICATION SKILL</h3>
              <p id="ocp">Communicating complex technical solutions in a way that clients understand is becoming increasingly important.

                For example, as an engineer, you might have a tendency to focus on the technical detail when clients are often more interested in finding solutions to their specific problem and understanding the benefits to their business, i.e. they are not necessarily interested in abstract theories or high-level science, particularly at management level.
                
                So, practice delivering highly technical information in as simple a way as possible while keeping your client’s perspective in mind.</p>
                <h3 id="tcp">2.PROBLEM SOLVING</h3>
                <p id="ocp">Problem-solving usually involves successfully considering the pros and cons of each solution and finding the path with the least risk involved.

                    Interviewers often consider problem-solving skills during the recruitment process because they show how candidates deal with challenges. After all, project managers and other leaders like having team members who don’t bring every small difficulty to their doorstep.
                    
                    Problem-solving skills can also help projects run more smoothly as well as helping to improve the business overall.</p>
                    N</h3>
              <h3 id="tcp">3.ORGANISATION</h3>
              <p id="ocp">In some situations, you can classify organisational skills as technical rather than soft. For example, good code needs to be well structured and organised. That said, there are also organisational skills you should improve that are non-technical.

                These include punctuality, task management, and not taking on more tasks than you can handle. One example of something you can work on is avoiding the temptation to get lost in your work as, when you do, project deadlines often suffer.</p>
                <h3 id="tcp">4.LEADERSHIP</h3>
                <p id="ocp">A good definition of leadership as a soft skill is taking responsibility for yourself and also for the people you work alongside. Remember, you don’t have to be in a managerial position to be a leader. Leadership is also about things like keeping the right distance from a task, so you can see the bigger picture, set the right example, and motivate others when things get tough.

                    Hone this skill and don’t forget to celebrate your leadership successes. Remember them as best practice examples too, so you can use them as a stepping stone for promotion.</p>
                    <h3 id="tcp">5.TEAM WORK</h3>
                    <p id="ocp">There are many engineering tasks that you will do alone. Writing code is a good example. Individuals can’t complete large engineering projects alone, however. Instead, they require teams and, by extension, teamwork.

                        As a result, teamwork is usually a non-negotiable soft skill in engineering. In other words, employers want you to be just as committed to successfully achieving team and company goals as you are for personal goals.</p>
                        <h3 id="tcp">6.ADAPTABILITY</h3>
                        <p id="ocp">With rapidly advancing technology, the reality of clients changing requirements, the increasing use of agile development techniques, and other factors, adaptability is an essential soft skill to improve. In fact, being willing and able to quickly adapt to situations is a skill highly valued by employers.</p>
                        <h3 id="tcp">7.CREATIVITY</h3>
                        <p id="ocp">In engineering, creativity is about finding new ways of looking at things. By developing this valuable soft skill, you’ll be able to, for example, develop innovative products or project solutions. Creativity can also help you solve a problem or successfully deal with an unexpected situation.

                        </p>
                        <h3 id="tcp">8.INTERPERSONAL SKILL</h3>
                        <p id="ocp"> 
                            Interpersonal skills are, in a sense, an umbrella term for several soft skills including active listening, social perceptiveness, and being able to handle feedback.

While it may not be possible to have great relationships with colleagues and others in all situations, developing your interpersonal skills will help you, those around you, and the company you work for.
                        </p>
                        <h3 id="tcp">9.CUSTOMER SERVICE</h3>
                        <p id="ocp">Finally, giving customers more than they expect helps to nurture long-term and loyal relationships. After all, customers are crucial to the success of most businesses. As a result, companies are more focused on customers than ever before. Developing your own customer service skills will help you contribute to the company’s efforts. </p>
